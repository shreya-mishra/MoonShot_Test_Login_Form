## MoonShot Test

**Design Mock Up** : [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/EjNZkDNTtgERV5PgF0mxnt/MERN-Assignment?type=design&node-id=33-667&mode=design)

**Description**

Develop a simple sign-up and login flow for an e-commerce website where users are able to mark the categories that they are Interested in.

You will see 4 screens in the design.

- First 2 are for the registration of new users, 
- the third one is for the login of an existing user 
- and the 4th one is a protected page that only logged in users can access. 
- On this protected page, users see a list of categories that we have in our database (you can use faker to generate this data - https://fakerjs.dev/). 
- Create 100 entries for the categories in your database using faker. Users can mark the categories that they are interested in. 
- This is a paginated list where only 6 categories are visible at a time. 
- Users can interact with pagination to see categories on various pages. 
- Users should be able to see what categories they selected when they logout and login again. 
- So we should store what they check in our database.

The header is common for all the pages. The header should be static for the scope of this assignment and should not have any interactions like menus flying out.
